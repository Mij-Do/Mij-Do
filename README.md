# Ahmed Samir 

**`Junior Front End Developer`**

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ahmed, a passionate front-end developer with a keen interest in creating clean, user-friendly interfaces and engaging web experiences. I specialize in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and have experience working with frameworks like Bootstrap.

Currently, I'm enhancing my skills in ReactJS and TypeScript, aiming to build scalable and efficient web applications. I enjoy solving coding challenges, exploring new technologies, and continuously improving my craft.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring tech blogs, contributing to my English study group, or diving into Marvel movies!
